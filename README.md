## ‚ú® 42 Adventure: The Ultimate Escape from the Blackhole! ‚ú®

**so_long** is a 2D game built as part of the 42 curriculum, where you play as a brave student navigating through the treacherous halls of 42 School. Your mission? Collect all the moulinettes (tests) and escape through the stairs before the deadly blackhole consumes you!

The game uses the MinilibX graphics library and relies on solid algorithms for path finding and real-time rendering.

## üîß Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository with submodules
git clone --recursive https://github.com/yourusername/so_long.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd so_long

# Compile the game
make

# Run the game with a map
./so_long maps/small.ber
```

### Dependencies

- MinilibX library (included as a submodule)
- X11 development libraries
- LibFT (included as a submodule)

If not using git clone with `--recursive`, initialize the submodules manually:

```bash
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

## üéÆ Game Controls

- **W**: Move up
- **A**: Move left
- **S**: Move down
- **D**: Move right
- **ESC**: Exit the game

## üó∫Ô∏è Map Format

Maps are defined in `.ber` files using the following characters:

- `1`: Wall
- `0`: Empty space
- `P`: Player starting position (must be exactly one)
- `E`: Exit/stairs (must be exactly one)
- `C`: Collectible/moulinette (must have at least one)

Example map:

```
1111111111111111
1E00000000C00001
1010010000010101
1010010101000101
1010010101000101
1P00000C000000C1
1111111111111111
```

### Map Rules

- Maps must be rectangular
- Maps must be enclosed by walls
- There must be exactly one player and one exit
- There must be at least one collectible
- There must be a valid path to collect all items and reach the exit
- Maximum dimensions: 30x15 tiles
